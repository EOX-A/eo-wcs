For each EO Coverage offered by the server under test:

* retrieve Lineage component information via _DescribeCoverage_,
  _DescribeEOCoverageSet_, and _GetCoverage_ operations. Check that all
  responses contain the same information.
* Send a valid _GetCoverage_ request to server under test. Check that the
  Lineage component consists of the Lineage component of the coverage requested
  with one record appended containing the complete, verbatim _GetCoverage_
  request leading to this response.

Test passes if all individual tests pass.
