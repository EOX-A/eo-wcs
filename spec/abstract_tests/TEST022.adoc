|Test purpose: |<</req/eowcs/rectifiedStitchedMosaic-offsetVector>>
|Test method:
a|
For each Rectified Stitched Mosaic offered by the server under test:

* retrieve the value of the `gml:offsetVector` elements of the domain set via
  _DescribeCoverage_, _DescribeEOCoverageSet_, and _GetCoverage_ operations.
* Check that all responses contain the same `offsetVector` information.
* For each obtained `dataset` _d_:
** retrieve coverage information via _DescribeCoverage_,
   _DescribeEOCoverageSet_, and _GetCoverage_ operations.
** Check that all responses contain the same `gml:offsetVector` information in
   their domain sets.
* Check that both the Rectified Stitched Mosaic and the Datasets the Rectified
  Stitched Mosaic refers to have identical values in the `gml:offsetVector`
  elements of their domain sets.

Test passes if all individual tests pass.
