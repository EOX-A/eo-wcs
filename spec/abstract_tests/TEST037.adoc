Send a valid _GetCapabilities_ request to the service under test. If a
`EOWCS::DatasetSeriesSummary` section is contained in the response then send,
for each `DatasetSeriesId`, a valid _DescribeEOCoverageSet_ request. Check that
none of these requests results in an exception. Test passes if all checks are
successful.
