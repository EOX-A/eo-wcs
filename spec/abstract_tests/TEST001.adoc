For each EO Coverage offered by the server under test:

* retrieve coverage information via _DescribeCoverage_,
  _DescribeEOCoverageSet_, and _GetCoverage_ operations.
* Check that the responses contain a `EOWCS::EOMetadata` corresponding to the
  definition and that all responses contain the same information.

Test passes if all individual tests pass.
