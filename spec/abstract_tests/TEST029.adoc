|Test method:

For each `EOWCS::DatasetSeries` offered by the server under test:

* Obtain the `footprint` of `EOWCS::DatasetSeries` via _DescribeEOCoverageSet_.
* Check that the locations of the `footprint` are expressed in WGS84.
* Obtain the footprints of all Stitched Mosaics and Datasets the Dataset Series
  refers to.
* Check that these footprints are enclosed in the `footprint` of
  `EOWCS::DatasetSeries`.

Test passes if all individual tests pass.
