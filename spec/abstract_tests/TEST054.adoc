|Test method:

For each EO Coverage offered by the server:

* Send a valid _GetCoverage_ request with a spatial request trim interval to
  server under test. Check that the footprint of the `EOWCS::EOMetadata` in the
  coverage returned is given by the intersection of the spatial request interval
  and the footprint of the coverage requested.
* Send a valid _GetCoverage_ request without a trimming interval to server under
  test. Check that the footprint in the result coverage is given by the
  footprint of the coverage requested.

Test passes if all individual tests pass.
