For each Stitched Mosaic offered by the server:

* send a valid _GetCoverage_ request with an effective spatio-temporal request
  trim interval to server under test.
* Check that the `EOWCS::EOMetadata` of the coverage returned contains the
  original Stitched Mosaic's references to those Datasets which have a non-empty
  intersection with the effective spatio-temporal request trim interval.

Test passes if all individual tests pass.
