For each EO Coverage offered by the server under test:

* retrieve coverage information via _DescribeCoverage_, _DescribeEOCoverageSet_,
  and _GetCoverage_ operations.
* Check that the responses contain an
  `eop:EarthObservation/eop:metadataProperty/eop:EarthObservationMetaData/eop:identifier`
  whose first word is identical to the EO Coverage identifier.

Test passes if all individual tests pass.
