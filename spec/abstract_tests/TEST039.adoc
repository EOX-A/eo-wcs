Send a valid _GetCapabilities_ request to the service under test. If a
`WCS::CoverageSummary` section is contained in the response then send, for each
coverage identifier, a valid _DescribeCoverage_ and a valid
_DescribeEOCoverageSet_ request. Check that none of these requests results in an
exception. Test passes if all individual tests pass.
