For each Stitched Mosaic offered by the server under test:

* retrieve coverage information via _DescribeCoverage_, _DescribeEOCoverageSet_,
  and _GetCoverage_ operations.
* For each obtained `dataset` _d_:
** obtain the contributingFootprint associated with the reference to _d_ and
   check that all responses contain the same contributingFootprint information
   with the reference to _d_.
** obtain the footprint of _d_ coverage via _DescribeCoverage_,
   _DescribeEOCoverageSet_, and _GetCoverage_ operations, and check that all
   responses contain the same footprint information.
** Check that the contributingFootprint associated with the reference to _d_ is
   contained in the footprint of _d_.
