|Test method:
a|
For each Rectified Stitched Mosaic offered by the server under test:

* For each obtained `dataset` _d_:
** retrieve coverage information via _DescribeCoverage_,
   _DescribeEOCoverageSet_, and _GetCoverage_ operations.
** Check that all responses contain the same `gml:offsetVector` information in
   their domain sets.
* Check that all Datasets have identical values in the `gml:offsetVector`
  elements of their domain sets.

Test passes if all individual tests pass.
