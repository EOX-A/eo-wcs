For each EO Coverage offered by the server under test:

* retrieve coverage information via _DescribeCoverage_, _DescribeEOCoverageSet_,
  and _GetCoverage_ operations.
* Check that the responses contain an
  `eop:EarthObservation/om:featureOfInterest/eop:Footprint` element in the
  `EOWCS::EOMetadata` and that all responses contain the same information.

Test passes if all individual tests pass.
