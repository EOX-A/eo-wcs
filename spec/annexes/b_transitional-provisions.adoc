== (normative) Transitional provisions

Clause <<normative_references>> of this specification normatively references
specifications under development and, hence, not yet available. For each such
specification, therefore, WCS 1.1 Corrigendum 2 [OGC 07-065r7] *shall* apply
until the respective specification gets adopted as an official OGC document.

NOTE: This requirement is not subject to conformance testing as WCS 1.1 does not
follow OGC's core/extension paradigm.
